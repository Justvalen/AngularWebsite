            These are the top 5 demographics represented in the LA Collosion Traffic data set. All demographics data were used in the findings below, but would make for a
            cluttered pie chart so they were only temporarily ommited visually. This list below is the total count of individuals who belong to their according racial group in decending order.

            This graph shows the aggregated data for daily accidents in the LA Traffic Collosion data set. The red dashed lines are the Upper Control Limit (UCL)
            and the Lower Control Limit (LCL). These limits are 3 standard deviations away from the mean. Which can be found in the middle with a solid red line.
            The years are further broken down into quarters so that we may observe different times of the year. From intially viewing the data there are a couple of things that stand out.

            While the aggregated graph showing the daily accidents was more clustered, this one highlights the insight we noticed more clearly. Indeed the accidents
            per month from the years 2010-2019 have been increasing and more specifically have been on the rise since mid 2013. That is not all however. That link I provided earlier
            about Los Angeles' growth shows an important detail.

            This next bar chart shows us an interesting tidbit. It seems that Los Angeles' number of accidents seem to increase from Saturday to an eventual high of Thursday before tapering off and repeating.
            From this we can infer a couple of things.
          </p>
          <ol class="intro-styles pg-font-size pg-width">
            <li><p class="list-font-size">Thursday is the most dangerous day to drive. Statstically speaking from this data, you would be more likely to have an accident on that day.</p></li>
            <li><p class="list-font-size">You are more likely to have an accident during the week than on the weekends. This obviously has many attributing factors, but in a city like Los Angeles I believe a fair guess would lay with people commuting to work.</p></li>
            <li><p class="list-font-size">Beyond the risks of driving on Thursday. The number of accidents is unusually higher than the other days of the week. As if to imply there is a direct causation for this. I suppose a native Angeleno could speak more to the findings.</p></li>

            Lastly, we have a heatmap indicating the frequency that each demographic is having accidents relative to the time of day. Outside of the top 5 demographics which were shown in the first
            graph it is more of a stretch to draw conclusive results from the other demographics due to their population size. I, however, for the sake of using all data provided decided to list them in
            the event future data can be found. From studying the heatmap I came away with these key insights.

          <ol class="intro-styles pg-font-size pg-width">
            <li><p class="list-font-size">Traffic accidents in Los Angeles seem to pick up from about 7am to 7pm (hours 7-19). It is also notably very bad from 5pm to 7pm (hours 17-19) which is apparantly LA's version of rush hour.</p></li>
            <li><p class="list-font-size">The frequency at which certain demographics seem to get involved in car accidents is quite consistent across the spectrum. Which is indicative that it is not so much an attributing factor to LA traffic accidents and that certain statistical suspects lay elsewhere.</p></li>
