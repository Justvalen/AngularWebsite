    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="lead">Hi there! My name is Justin Valenzuela and welcome to my website.<br><br> In the interest of making information
    easier to find I decided to break it up into smaller topics you can browse if you so desire. Thank you for taking

      <h1>Where am I now?</h1>
      <p class="lead">I am actively seeking employment as a Software Developer. I have my language roots in Java and Python with some branching
      interests into web development. I made this website with the goal in mind of showcasing that I am capable of working with the full architecture
      of a stack.<br><br> I believe myself to be a fast learner and I am not afraid to jump into new topics. I believe as a developer for your company
      I can make a valuable addition to your team. Given the chance I will exemplify hard work and dedication to your future projects.</p>

    <div id="WhatTechDoIKnow" class="offset">
      <h1>What technologies do I know?</h1>
      <p class="lead">My main languages are Java and Python. However, I have familiarized myself quite well with Angular 8 and TypeScript/JavaScript for this project. While TS/JS are not my main languages I
      believe it relevant to highlight that I can produce in them.<br><br> I am not afraid to challenge myself and step out of the comfort zone to build in
      technologies that are new to me.<br><br>Below are some examples of such new technologies I learned to create this project and many others.</p>
      <br>
      <ol class="lead">
        <li><p class="lead">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</p></li>
          <ul class="lead">
            <li><p class="lead">Registered my website domain via Route 53 and retrieved my SSL certificate from the AWS certificate manager</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead">Hosted all website files via S3 to allow for static website hosting</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead">Utilized Cloudfront to allow for a faster content delivery network</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead">Set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using CodePipeline and CodeBuild. This was made possible by syncing my
            github with CodePipeline whenever I make commits</p></li>
          </ul>
        <li><p class="lead">Angular 8 / Bootstrap</p></li>
          <ul class="lead">
            <li><p class="lead">Learned Angular 8 from scratch and read much of the documentation which proved invaluable</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead">With that knowledge I created highly modularized components and followed standards for encapsulated component CSS</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead">Utilized the Bootstrap library to create a more responsive components</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead">Component prototypes were built quickly using this method which lead to smoother development</p></li>
          </ul>

      <h1>Some history about me.</h1>
      <p class="lead">My name is Justin Valenzuela and I am a recent Washington state transplant. I was born and raised in California and enjoyed much of what the
      state has to offer. However, after graduating from California State University, Sacramento, I have come to pursue a career in Software
      Development in the Northwest.<br><br> I have always had a deep passion for learning and problem solving that permeates into all faucets of my hobbies.
      Regardless of the situation I find myself naturally trying to optimize the solution and facilitate desired outcomes.<br><br> I am someone who values
      their place on a team. I will be the first to offer assistance and share knowledge if I can. In this way I like to be a contributor. If I
      see myself lacking in knowledge or skill I go and learn it.<br><br> When I am not contributing to my personal projects I spend my freetime thrift
      shopping in the Greater Seattle Area and finding new hidden foodie locations.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="lead">I hope this gives you some insight into the kind of person/developer I am. If you would like to know more I am only an email or phone call away.
      Down below you will find all my contact information along with some links to my other media presence.</p>
