    <h1 class="display-4">About Me</h1>
    <p class="lead">Hi there! My name is Justin Valenzuela and welcome to my website. In the interest of making information
    easier to find I decided to break it up into smaller topics you can browse if you so desire. Thank you for taking
    the time to learn more about me.
    </p>

    <div id="WhereAmINow" class="offset">
      <h1 class="display-5" style="font-size: 30px;">Where am I now?</h1>
      <p class="lead">I am actively seeking employment as a Software Developer. I have my language roots in Java and Python with some branching
      interests into web development. I made this website with the goal in mind of showcasing that I am capable of working with the full architecture
      of a stack. I believe myself to be a fast learner and I am not afraid to jump into new topics. I believe as a developer for your company
      I can make a valuable addition to your team. Given the chance I will exemplify hard work and dedication to your future projects.</p>

    <div id="WhatTechDoIKnow" class="offset">
      <h1 class="display-5" style="font-size: 30px;">What technologies do I know?</h1>
      <p class="lead">My main languages are Java and Python. However, I have familiarized myself quite well with Angular 8 and TypeScript/JavaScript for this project. While TS/JS are not my main languages I
      believe it relevant to highlight that I can produce in them. I am not afraid to challenge myself and step out of the comfort zone to build in
      technologies that are new to me.<br><br>Below are some examples of such new technologies I learned to create this project and what I did with them.</p>
      <br>
      <ol class="lead">
        <li><p class="lead">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</p></li>
          <ul class="lead">
            <li><p class="lead">Registered my website domain via Route 53 and retrieved my SSL certificate from the AWS certificate manager</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead">Hosted all website files via S3 to allow for static website hosting</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead">Utilized Cloudfront to allow for a faster content delivery network</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead">Set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using CodePipeline and CodeBuild. This was made possible by syncing my
            github with CodePipeline whenever I make commits</p></li>
          </ul>
        <li><p class="lead">Angular 8 / Bootstrap</p></li>
          <ul class="lead">
            <li><p class="lead">Learned Angular 8 from scratch and read much of the documentation which proved invaluable</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead">With that knowledge I created highly modularized components and followed standards for encapsulated component CSS</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead">Utilized the Bootstrap library to create a more responsive components</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead">Component prototypes were built quickly using this method which lead to smoother development</p></li>
          </ul>
        <li><p class="lead">Django Rest API (Work in Progress 2/20/2020)</p></li>
          <ul class="lead">
            <li><p class="lead">Currently learning and developing in Django with Python to develop an API for my website</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead">The API will be used to retrieve highscore data from my AWS database for my Minesweeper game</p></li>
            <li><p class="lead">The Minesweeper game is being built in Java and once both are finished I will create their own page on the website</p></li>
          </ul>

      <h1 class="display-5" style="font-size: 30px;">Some history about me.</h1>
      <p class="lead">I grew up and have lived all over sunny California. From Los Angeles to Sacramento I enjoyed all the state has to offer. From camping on beaches as a kid in boy scouts
      to paintballing on our friends open land in the Central Valley for many years California was my home.<br><br>After college graduation from California State University
      Sacramento, I came here to Washington to pursue a career in Software Development in the Seattle area. I have always had a love for the sciences, for logic and reason. I am
      natural tinkerer and problem solver. Those who know me know I love to stand up and walk around as I think. Talking myself through the problems and trying to prove my own
      assertions wrong; being my own devils advocate.<br><br>I am someone who values their place on a team. I'll be the first to offer assistance and share knowledge If I can. In this way I like to be a contributor.
      My passion not only extends to learning, but also to teaching. If I see myself lacking in some knowledge or skill I go and learn it. This way I can be of assistance and pass it forward. It is
      also my goal for my team to value me as someone who is reliable and easy to talk to. Nothing makes for a better team than clear communication.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="lead">Well I hope this gives you some insight into the kind of person/developer I am. If you would like to know more I am only an email or phone call away.
      Down below you will find all my contact information along with some links to my other media presence.</p>
